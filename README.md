# Inferno Collection: Pass Alarm
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Police-Panic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Police-Panic)

__Public Beta Version 1.2 Beta__

The Police Panic script is a simple Standalone script that allows Officers to tune into a "Panic Channel", which allows them to receive Panic Button activations, as well as activate their own Panic Button. Once a Panic Button is activated, all tuned Officers will hear an Emergency tone, followed by the name of the Officer, their nearest street and cross street, as well as a large flashing blip on their map, with a flashing map route; these will only display for a few seconds.

Presently, the following can be customized:
- Cooldown time between activations
- Chat Messages
- Toggleable notifications and chat suggestions
- Which players can use which command (via a whitelist).
- Choice of three whitelist options:
    1. Steam ID based JSON file
    2. Ace Permissions
    3. No whitelist
